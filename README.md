# Hand-Gesture-Recognition
A few simple applications for hand gesture recognition with OpenCV and Python. 

## About
I've been trying to learn to learn a little more about human computer interaction and thought I'd start off with this simple project.
All I've got to work with is the VGA nose cam on my laptop though, and it's hard to judge how well/ badly my code would perform otherwise on standard/good feeds.

If you use my code, let me know what you think!

## Setup

This project was developed using VS Code and Python 3.7.4
I'd recommend using a virtual environment to prevent conflicting package dependencies across different projects. You can find some helpful hints in the [tips section](./Tips.md).
